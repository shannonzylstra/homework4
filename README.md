## The Instructions

#### Problem 1: Use Sage to investigate the following problem in number theory. 
    
Let f(x)=x^2 + a*x + b be a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients, for example, f(x) = x^2+x+6.    
Formulate a conjecture about when the set {f(n) : n in Z and f(n) is prime} is infinite.     
Paste a link below to a file or directory on github.    

#### Problem 2: Distribution of primes modulo n.  
 Â   
Let n=15. 
(1) Plot a frequency histogram that shows how the prime numbers up to 10^7 are distributed modulo n. (stats.TimeSeries has a nice histogram method).    
(2) Make a conjecture based on your data.    
(3) Obtain data for other values of n and make a more general conjecture. (This is known as Dirichlet's theorem.)    
    

#### Problem 3: Find my secret rational number.

I made up a rational number alpha whose numerator and denominator each have 7 digits.     
Here's two facts about that rational number:    
(1) it is congruent to 372806624339965 modulo 37+10^15;    
(2) its decimal expansion begins 0.13869616280169693.... What do you think my rational number is?    
    
## Problem 1

I investigated the Euler-like polynomials in a sage worksheet, saved as problem_1.sagews (add link to this).    
    
## Problem 2
    
...
    
## Problem 3
    
Alpha is 1234567/8901234. Reasoning to come.
